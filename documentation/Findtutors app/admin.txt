when reviewing changes made on tutor profile, only add comments when you want to notify tutor about reviews to make on 
profile.

adding or deleting admin_comment triggers an email notif to be sent to the user.

In cases where you are approving a tutor profile, just check the admin_show to ticked. Do not delete admin_comment
as it will trigger an email telling them their profile isn't live.
